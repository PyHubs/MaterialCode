# Material Code
Material Code is a simple, and beautiful `Python` text editor! It uses Tkinter, and has a very _flat UI_. It is really easy to use, and very basic.

## Features
- Basic features such as Open, Save, Save as
- A embedded terminal (xterm) on *linux**
- A built in file sidebar! (Slightly bugged)
- Simple to use UI.


## Warnings
- This application is discontinued. No bugs will be fixed. [Email me,](mailto:pycodes.10@gmail.com) I might fix it.
